成员身份
==========

PHP 框架互用工作组（PHP-FIG）的成员身份由成员项目构成。本章程定义了成员的规则与权利。

定义
-----------

<dl>
    <dt><strong>Member Project</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        Any PHP project with voting rights admitted to PHP-FIG after
        submitting an application to the PHP-FIG mailing list under the
        Member Application procedure described in this bylaw.
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>Voting Representative</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        Any individual granted the right to cast votes on behalf of a Member
        Project.
    </dd>
</dl>

成员列表
---------------

当前 PHP-FIG 的成员项目将被列举在这个页面： http://www.php-fig.org.cn/members/

这个列表还必须标出各个成员项目当前的投票代表。当成员项目或投票代表有所变动时，这个列表必须要更新。

成员应用
----------------------

为 PHP-FIG 提议进行投票，要求 PHP 项目申请成为成员项目。申请可以被该 PHP 项目授权的任何个体提交。

申请必须以邮件形式发送给 [PHP-FIG 邮件列表][list] 
并限制为每个邮箱仅对应一个申请。为了保证申请是经慎重考虑的，所有申请必须得到至少一位投票代表的预先担保。

邮件标题必须符合以下格式：

    Membership Request: {$your_name} ({$project_name})
    
邮件内容应该提供要申请成员身份的 PHP 项目细节，包括名称，URL，发起提议的投票代表名字，给予担保的投票代表名字，以及其它任何 PHP 
项目的申请者认为有必要包含的细节。

从会员身份发起请求到开始投票必须至少历时两周，从而方便进行必要的讨论。

接下来成员身份申请的表决可以由已有的成员项目根据投票协议章程进行。PHP-FIG 必须执行检查以便确保申请是有效的，并且申请人的代表已经得到了对应 PHP
 项目的授权。一旦表决完成并且申请被通过，该 PHP 项目将成为成员项目，立即生效。

PHP 项目可能会申请成为成员项目的次数没有限制。

投票代表
-----------------------

所有成员项目投出的票都是由成员项目授权的投票代表完成。各个投票代表都由成员项目单独选择，并不需要等待 PHP-FIG 
批准。投票代表可以在任何时间被其代表的成员项目替换掉。

为防止非法或错误投票，投票代表必须由对应成员项目通过发送一封资格确认邮件至[邮件列表][list
]进行确认。如果申请人足够权威，资格确认邮件可以和成员身份申请一并进行。其它成员项目可以在投票代表任期内确认其资格。

一个成员项目可以同时拥有多个投票代表。

如果得到所在的成员项目授权，投票代表可以临时授予其投票权至其它人。授权必须由当前投票代表通过发送邮件至[邮件列表][list]通知 
PHP-FIG
。邮件中必须说明临时投票代表的名字和其临时投票权的有效期。在邮件说明的有效期结束，所有投票权将自动归还给原始的投票代表。所有写明的日期都应该包含时区。如果没有写明时区，则被看作 UTC 时间。

如果，根据 PHP-FIG 的判断，一个投票代表行为失当并有损 PHP-FIG 
实现自身目标的能力，根据[投票协议章程][voting]，可能会发起替换掉对应投票代表的决议，如果替换投票代表没能成行，将会开除对应的成员项目。

成员项目辞呈
------------------------------

成员项目可以从 PHP-FIG 辞职，通过发送一封辞职邮件至[邮件列表][list]或通过其它渠道陈述意图。一旦陈述发布，该 PHP 
项目即刻退出成员项目。

前成员项目可以在未来任何时间再次申请成员身份。

开除成员项目
----------------------------

成员项目可能被从 PHP-FIG 开除。如果，根据 PHP-FIG 的判断，
A Member Project may be expelled from PHP-FIG if, in the judgement of PHP-FIG,
that Member Project has not casted votes in three consecutive voting calls or all voting
calls over a period no less than six months whichever constitutes the greater
period of time. It is the responsibility of Member Projects to ensure that they
are actively represented by a Voting Representative.

A Member Project may also be expelled if their Voting Representative is subject
to a replacement request from PHP-FIG but a suitable replacement is not
available.

The expulsion of a Member Project requires a vote in accordance with the
[Voting Protocol bylaw][voting].

FIG Secretary
-------------

### Overarching role

The primary responsibility of the FIG Secretary is to serve as an impartial
administrator of the FIG. They serve at the member projects pleasure but act as
independent and impartial adjudicators. FIG Secretaries will also represent the
FIG as a whole to the general community and public on matters relating to the
FIG's activities.

Whilst there are a number of defined functions below but they should also perform
other duties as required. As the role has continuity (in that there will always
be a post holder) and redundancy (There are a number of post holders in case of
the absence of one) it can be ensured that responsibilities assigned to the
secretary will always be completed and therefore administrative responsibilities
such as vote management should always be assigned to the FIG Secretary.

All FIG Secretaries are expected to remain impartial and professional when acting
in an official capacity as secretary and should also remain aware that even when
not acting in an official capacity, their actions reflect back on the PHP FIG and
the FIG must not be brought into disrepute.

### Defined functions

There are a number of defined functions that the FIG Secretaries are expected to
complete but they may also, within their remit defined in the above overarching
role above, perform other duties as nessasary.

* Keeping the website, twitter and other marketing mediums up-to-date
* GitHub organization administration
* Tallying votes
* Tracking member project activity, and marking projects as inactive
* Ensuring bylaws are being followed
* Clarifying any interpretation of bylaw text (If there is lack of consensus
between FIG Secretaries then it must be put to a full vote according to the
standard [Voting Protocol bylaw][voting]).
* Ensure that relevant marketing mediums (e.g. Twitter and Facebook) are kept
professional, up to date and impartial.
* Moderate discussions on github, the mailing list and IRC channels to ensure
that an appropriate environment is maintained
* Should there be a FIG meeting at a conference or other ad hoc gathering any
Secretary in attendance should take notes to report back to the mailing list.

### Access and Abilities

FIG Secretaries will be given access to the GitHub organisation as 'Owners' and
full (admin) access to anything relating to official website, marketing and
communication mediums including but not limited to the domain, twitter, IRC
channel, packagist packages and mailing list in order to allow them to complete
their duties and ensure that FIG mediums are managed by representatives elected
by the PHP FIG.

Also, whilst not full members themselves, they have the ability to start any
vote (just as any member project), but not cast any votes. However it should be
noted that any vote started by one FIG Secretary must be managed and tallied by a
different secretary to ensure impartiality.

### Selection:

Secretaries serve a two year term and the three secretaries votes are staggered
eight months apart. One secretary is elected in January of even numbered years,
one secretary is elected in August of even numbered years, and one secretary is
voted upon in May of odd numbered years. For example there would be elections in
January 2018, August 2018 and May 2019.

In the special case of the first election of secretaries, the three secretaries
will be selected using Single Transferable Vote (Using the Droop Quota and Hare
Counting Method). The first candidate to achieve enough votes will serve a term
until the following January, the second candidate to achieve enough votes will
serve a term until the following August and the third candidate to achieve enough
votes will serve a term until the following May. If two or three candidates achieve
enough votes at the same time then whoever achieved the higher number of first
place votes will serve the longer term, and in the event that they achieved the
same number of second place votes, then it shall be done on the number of second
place votes and so on.

If more than one secretary is nominated and only one secretary is being elected
we use Instant-Runoff Voting. Where only one candidate is nominated then instead
of Instant Runoff the standard [Voting Protocol][voting] will be used.

Once voted in, Secretaries are then in post until such a time as they resign,
are removed by a vote of no confidence or until the end of their term.

On the last Sunday in one of the above mentioned months, the term finishes for the
existing secretary and the voted upon secretary (who may be the same individual)
will take up post. Any secretaries who are still eligible may re-stand for election
as a secretary at this time. The vote for the new secretaries must be started no
earlier than the first Sunday in the month and conclude at least one day before the
previous secretaries leave post. The vote will be performed by the most recently
elected secretary. The mailing list topic must be titled '[Vote] PHP FIG Secretary
{MONTH} {YEAR}'.

Secretaries must be nominated/proposed by an existing PHP FIG representative or
FIG Secretary to be considered in the vote by an email to the mailing list.
People who wish to stand as secretary may seek proposers in any way they see fit
(An email to the mailing list appealing or individual contact with FIG Members).
In a situation where no secretary is elected, the other secretaries in post may
use their discretion as to how to proceed (for example a second vote).

Any member project may call a vote of no confidence in a FIG Secretary where, if
the majority (according to the [Voting Protocol bylaw][voting]) vote in favour of
their dismissal, they will be removed with immediate effect. The recording and
tallying of votes in this instance is to be managed by another secretary together
with the member project who called the vote. A vote of no confidence must be
preceeded by a one-week discussion on the mailing list.

In the event of a resignation of a FIG Secretary or a vote of no confidence, they
shall be removed with immediate effect and an existing FIG Secretary should
commence a vote for a new secretary according to the aforementioned protocols.
In the event of a resignation a special election will be performed following a
similar procedure to regular elections under the administration of the remaining
FIG Secretaries. The newly elected secretary would serve the remainder of the term
that the outgoing secretary would have completed.

### Eligibility Criteria:
The role should be filled by three people (working together to ensure
impartiality in all matters and continuous availability) at any one time and
those individuals must not be:
* Project Representatives of a Member Project
* An Editor of a PSR that is in Draft phase

If during a secretary's term they become ineligible they must resign.
